## Fixed Issues

### 1. Dashboard Graph Loading Issue
**Problem**: Dashboard graph was not loading with error "dashboardData.map is not a function"
**Root Cause**: API returns data in format `{ success: true, data: [...], error: null }` but frontend tried to call .map() directly on response
**Fix**: Modified Dashboard.tsx to extract data from response.data and check if it's an array before mapping

### 2. Transaction Submission Error Handling
**Problem**: Submit transaction only showing "missing or invalid fields" error
**Root Cause**: Error message parsing in DataEntry.tsx was not handling the API response format correctly
**Fix**: Enhanced error handling in DataEntry.tsx to properly parse API error responses

### 3. API Response Format Handling
**Problem**: Inconsistent handling of API response formats across different endpoints
**Fix**: Updated src/lib/api.js to properly handle the Dashboard API response format

## Security Improvements

### Environment Variables Protection
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent exposing sensitive keys
- Removed previously exposed keys from repository history
- Ensured all sensitive information is properly secured

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** components built on Radix UI
- **React Router** for navigation
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Date-fns** for date manipulation

### Development Tools
- **pnpm** as package manager
- **ESLint** for code linting
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Prettier** for code formatting

## API Endpoints

The application communicates with a backend API with the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/kpis` - Fetch key performance indicators
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Fetch dashboard data for charts
- `GET /api/top-revenue-items` - Fetch top revenue-generating items
- `GET /api/expenses-by-category` - Fetch expense breakdown by category
- `GET /api/transactions` - Fetch transaction history
- `POST /api/transactions` - Create new transactions

## Components

### Core Components
- **Layout** - Main application layout with header and navigation
- **KPICard** - Key performance indicator cards for dashboard
- **DateFilter** - Date range selection component
- **ProtectedRoute** - Route protection for authenticated pages

### UI Components
- Built using shadcn/ui components which are based on Radix UI
- Customized with Tailwind CSS
- Includes forms, tables, charts, dialogs, and more

## Pages

1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Main analytics view with charts and KPIs
2. **Data Entry** (`/data-entry`) - Form for adding new transactions
3. **Reports** (`/reports`) - Detailed financial reporting
4. **Login** (`/login`) - Authentication page
